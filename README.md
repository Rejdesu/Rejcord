# Custom CSS snippets for Discord

This is just a collection of CSS snippets that I think are neat. I did not create any of these. This is my first time uploading stuff to GitHub, sorry for any mistakes.


## Installation

Import main css file or copy and paste whatever you want to use from the file. (im too lazy to seperate each snippet into their own file, maybe one day)

```css
@import url('placeholder'); /*place this at the very top of your custom CSS if you plan on using the entire main file*/
```

## Imports

Some CSS snippets will require you to use the import links at the top of the main CSS file. Make sure to check them out if you think you'll need them and make sure to place them at the very top of your file.

```css
/*css required and provided*/
@import url('//objectiveslayer.github.io/bd-snippets/customizable-toolbar.css');

/*css required and provided*/
@import url('https://mwittrien.github.io/BetterDiscordAddons/Themes/SettingsModal/SettingsModal.css');

/*standalone import*/
@import url('https://maendisease.github.io/BetterDiscordStuff/css/bearableInbox.css'); 

/*standalone import. replace 'Emoji' with your choice: Apple, Facebook, Google, JoyPixels, Microsoft, OpenMoji, Samsung, WhatsApp*/
@import url('https://mwittrien.github.io/BetterDiscordAddons/Themes/EmojiReplace/base/Emoji.css'); 

```
